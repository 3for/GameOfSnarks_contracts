## Initial set of smart-contracts and fraud proof for the game of SNARKs

### Rationale

When the game will be "Plasmafied" there should exist a set of fraud proof if Plasma operator does not correctly update the state of the game. In addition challenges should be implemented if one of the players goes offline.
